## Introduction

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

On May 4th 2023, Next.js 13.4 was released, marking stability for the App Router. You can read the blog post [here](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13-4). This introduces the concept of server components! It seems the React and Next.js teams have been working closely together to push React components down to the server. You can read more about the concept in the [Next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#thinking-in-server-components) as well as in [this post](https://react.dev/blog/2023/03/22/react-labs-what-we-have-been-working-on-march-2023#react-server-components) from the React team.

I am creating this repo as a learning demo, so I can learn this new mental model.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npx next dev --turbo
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
